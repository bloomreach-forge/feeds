      <subsection name="What is the Feed Creator?">
        <p>
          <b>Feed Creator</b> is a plugin for Bloomreach Experience Manager, f.k.a. Hippo CMS, that lets you create
          <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS feeds</a> and
          <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php">ATOM feeds</a>. It provides
          an API that enables you to create your own web syndications with the CMS, using documents. You can create as
          many feeds as you like, and for each feed you can setup filters to determine which documents to include.
